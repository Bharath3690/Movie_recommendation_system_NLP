# Movie_recommendation_system_NLP
This project aimed to build a personalized movie recommendation engine. The problem I addressed was helping users discover movies based on their preferences and behavior.

I combined content-based filtering using movie metadata (like genres and cast) with collaborative filtering based on user ratings to form a hybrid system. For NLP, I used TF-IDF on movie overviews. I integrated the TMDB API to enhance the frontend with dynamic movie posters.
It is a hybrid movie recommendation system combining content-based and collaborative filtering. For content-based, I used movie metadata like genre and description (with TF-IDF), and for collaborative filtering, I used user ratings to suggest similar preferences.

The system was deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input their preferences and get instant recommendations. I also added a user feedback loop to improve suggestions over time.
